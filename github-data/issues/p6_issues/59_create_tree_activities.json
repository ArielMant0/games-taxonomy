Furthermore some games have game components that are not the main component but might still be usefull to tag. Originally this came from the controvers _contradiction_ tag but there are other examples like dungeons in [Tomb Raider](https://store.steampowered.com/app/203160/Tomb_Raider/). It might be possible to combine all of those in an activities tree."
