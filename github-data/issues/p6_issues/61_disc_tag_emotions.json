One problem with this would be the disconnect between what happens in the game and what the player feels - even though a game might be about grief the player might still feel happiness ([Gris](https://store.steampowered.com/app/683320/GRIS/)). This might or might not be worth tagging anyway, since it might also be interesting and remarkable when such games would be tagged with positive emotions."
