This is similar to depicting the complexity of an automation, for which an alternative representation using _high level_ and _low level_ was proposed. This differentiation might especially be important for externalization features, since it could be more likely that a game with complex automations provides some tool for that. In contrast to that a _configure_ automation might be likely to be shown via an interface allowing only to select components or values."
