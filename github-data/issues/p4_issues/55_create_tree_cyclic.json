The main focus of this tag were games like FTL, that give the player an incentive to play the game again and again after a finished round. Finishing a round unlocks game elements that impact future runs. This content provides new challenges for the player for example in terms of difficulty. Generally similarities to new game+ modi can be found, but even if a second run allows to solve previously unsolvable puzzles the difficulty stays the same and the player is not forced to adjust his strategy. Similarly games like The Stanley Parable allow the player to adjust his playstyle based on information collected in previous runs or require the player to repeatedly play the story to gain access to the complete narrative. Finally it must be mentioned that curiosity is not sufficient to call a game cyclic since this is an internal player motivation. Furthermore games like Banished and Anno provide an opposite gameplay loop because these games are open ended."

Further discussion revealed an overlap with procedural generation (non handmade content), this allowed us for the moment to add the randomness as a replayability subtree while representing specific randomness components in the meta mechanics. This was especially related to games like No Man's Sky, where a game component is generated randomly once at game start but not during the game itself. One idea was to only tag replayability randomness if game components change at the beginning of the game â€“ this proposal was discarded until further discussion, since random components during the game are a vital part of replayability. Finally it was proposed to add a difficulty scaling tag to the meta progression tree."

Here it is apparent that randomness plays an important role in the player replaying the game. But we also found that the duration of a playthrough highly influences the impact of randomness and therefore of the replayability. This can have various characteristics, for example a game that was only played 5 hours might still contain content that the player did not see and that is new, original and exciting â€“ while a longer game might use all its resources in one playthrough even if further playthroughs change specific values like health points or similar. (Borderlands). This all can be seen as part of the level of suspense or fun which might decrease over time and might impact the players readiness to start a second round. In conclusion we opted to add two tags, one for games with a short cycle (<5h) and one for games with a long cycle (>5h). Still unclear are games that also have an open ended cycle."
