Therefore the game over condition is directly related to conditions that let the player win or lose. Hence every end state that is available was reached by triggering a game over condition. This in turn means, that a game that does not have an end state would also not have a game over condition. Basically this tag identifies situations in which the game itself stops the player from continuing to play - this does also include situations in which the player would resolve the issue by reloading."
