Here the differentiation between _monsters_ and _creatures_ was difficult. One initial idea was to use sentience and consciousness for identification, since aliens might fly with a spaceship, while creatures like animals might not. Unfortunately this does not hold up against fantasy creatures that might have build a civilization or can talk - for example a dragon could be a simple creature, but could also be a creature with a history or similar ([TES V: Skyrim](https://store.steampowered.com/app/489830/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim_Special_Edition/)). Additionally we found, that the original idea is to indicate whether a game has dragons or not rather than showing how advanced they are. On the other hand it is difficult to identify games that have _creatures_ or similar as tag anyway - even though [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us) has _monsters_ and _creatures_ (animals) neither should be a topic of this game. Finally we wondered whether it might be important to add animals as a tag for example for games like [Pferd & Pony: Mein Pferdehof](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limbic_Entertainment) where the horse would be an essential part of the game and _creatures_ might not sufficiently represent that."
