Generally speaking a minigame can be understood as a game within a game, made to break up the gameplay and entertain over a short period [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minigame). In most cases the minigame appears differently than the maingame, for example by altering the UI, disabling physics or by a different control scheme. While there are minigames that have near trivial content there are also those that still have complex rules for example in form of a card game. Additionally a minigame can be seen as a task of lesser importance and with a low frequency of repetition, meaning that the player is not forced to play the minigame multiple times or over a long period."

                            "body": "Following this we discussed if a minigames needs to be optional content or if such a game element can still be called minigame if it is mandatory. Often minigames are required to gain access to specific rewards (unlocking chests). While these rewards are usually not required to end a game, they can be mandatory to complete some quests which allow the player to progress ([The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition](https://store.steampowered.com/app/489830/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim_Special_Edition/)). In those cases the player would be hindered from finishing the questline (soft lock) when the player is not able to beat or win the minigame. In some games this might also happen during the main story ([BioShockâ„¢](https://store.steampowered.com/app/7670/BioShock/)). Based on this we concluded, that whether a minigame is mandatory or not does not impact its state as a minigame."

Even though minigames and quicktime events are similar in terms of the short time period the player interacts with them and the often enclosed appearance, they have multiple key differences, that made us not include quicktime events as minigames. Basically a quicktime event is a section in the game in which the player needs to press one button or a sequence of buttons as soon as it is displayed on the screen. This does test the reaction time of the player and the ability to find the correct key fast enough. Even though it is possible to view this as a minigame we decided to categorize it as a mechanic, mainly due to the simple rules and the low complexity. Therefore while a quicktime event is not regarded as a minigame, a minigame can still contain quicktime evets."
