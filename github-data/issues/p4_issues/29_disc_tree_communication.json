These tools in them selves are not the _problem solving technique_ but rather are used to solve the problem. The technique itself can better be described by _collaboration_ with the intent to _share information_ similarly to _gather information_. Other terms that describe this process would be _exchanging information_ or _distribute information_. The important component of these is the intent to solve a given problem or task."
