But one should keep in mind, that _making a choice_ is not the same as _gather information_ even though this tag is currently used for this. This gets more clear when talking about _emotional challenges_ where it is questionable what the _problem solving technique_ is. This does not mean, that choosing a dialog option is necessaryly the solving technique, since it is more what you do rather then a coping mechanism."
