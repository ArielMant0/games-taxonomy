Further discussion revealed, that manual highlights of information can also be seen as part of _info: tag_, since this is very similar to marking the information. This lead to us renaming _info: tag_ to _info: mark/tag_. Finally we found that _info: hide_ is also incomplete, since it should include showing information.
