The other part of accusation would be the mechanical implications like when the game provides mechanics to accuse someone for example in form of dialog options. This might not be represented in the tree well enough, but for this another term would be required, since even though the accusation tag implies a mechanical feature it does not describe it. Especially the difference to usual dialog options is unclear and heavily dependent on the context. This makes it difficult, since it might be useful to differentiate between detective games, that provide these mechanics and those which do not, but concurrently this would specializes the tree for those games."

                            "body": "When comparing normal dialog options to an accusation, it can be observed that an accusation is likely to have **consequences** in the game. Unfortunately not every dialog option with a consequence is an accusation, making differentiation difficult again. Furthermore accessing the relevance of a consequence or the impact of an accusation is also difficult, for example a game showing accusations without the input of the player via cutscenes could be difficult to judge depending on the context or when choosing one out of N options, does the number of possibilities impact the tag?"

Here we differentiate games that give the player a list of tasks to do followed by an accusation and games that give more freedom resulting in the player being required to make a decision under uncertainty. In both cases this might be part of narrative choices and branches since both cases do not result in the player replaying the section, but instead the game continuing with the made choice."
