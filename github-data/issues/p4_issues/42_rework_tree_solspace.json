When talking about solution space one can either think about the ways how to end a game - this is similar to issue #50 and #56. Especially the game over condtion subtree is a better description of this. The other way to understand solution space are the number of ways to get to the end of the game. Even though in this context it is not directly related to _replayability_ the _gameplay branches_ tag does represent this feature better then the solution space in its current form could. Additionally there is also the _narrative branches_ tag to capture this part of possibilites. **This lead us to conclude to delete this subtree.**"
