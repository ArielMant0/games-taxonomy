Both options can not be used for inworld objects like _signs_ that also indicate a direction but without the use of the GUI. Even though the difference might be minial these are differently designed features, since such signs are static and do not react to the players actions. To allow representing this we for now added the tag _sp: other_ such that special cases can be looked at in the future."

This would need to be discussed further."
