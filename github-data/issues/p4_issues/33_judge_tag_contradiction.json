This is expected to be part of _logic puzzles_ and _apply rules_ or similar tags, therefore excluding games like [Return of the Obra Dinn](https://store.steampowered.com/app/653530/Return_of_the_Obra_Dinn/) or [Hexcells](https://store.steampowered.com/app/265890/Hexcells/), since the data the game provides does not in itself contradict itself. These games provide logic puzzles or riddles that can be solved by applying certain techniques, but are not tailored around contradiction. Consequently such games do not provide a specific mechanic to e.g. mark contradictions, which also applies to [Among Us](https://store.steampowered.com/app/945360/Among_Us/) where only the statements of players can contradict and even in these cases there is no specific game mechanic for it."

This can also influence the mechanics the game provides, but is also dependent on the semantic. Especially based on [Her Story](https://store.steampowered.com/app/368370/Her_Story/) we found, that the player also brings a certain mindset to the game - in this case the goal to find inconsistencies. Which might be sufficiently be portrayed by _detective work_, _social deduction_ or _gather information_."
