Firstly it is difficult to access this as an uninformed person that does not do this professionally since it might require in depth game knowledge and generally a system to compare games to each other. Such a tag would simple be more difficult to tag than for example tags related to minigames or visual features. Secondly it is not guaranteed that a user would rate a game consistently at different time points, meaning the values would be subject to change, which in turn would require the user to regularly update corelated tags."

We therefore shifted the focus to a technical solution: Instead of using tags we aim to add a feature to the [collacode](https://github.com/ArielMant0/collacode) application allowing it to crawl various information about the games from said rating organizations. This would allow for updates when ratings change and would also shift the responsibility for correct data to the organizations."
