Nevertheless we opted to discuss the topic and began by answering a few basic questions. Firstly it was important to define whether the goal of a game might be equal to the ending of a game. This proposition was rejected and the end state was defined as something that is not required to be the narrative ending. Regardless of this distinction we were not able to clearly define the goal of the game and instead discussed why the tag might be needed. The reason being the idea to construct a sentence defining key properties of a game."
