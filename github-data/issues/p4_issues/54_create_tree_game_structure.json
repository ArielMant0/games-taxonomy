This subtree is supposed to show the structured form the game uses to present its content. A key distinction to be made was a game being a match or a game containing matches. Especially for this we added the match based identifier, which allows us to tag the structure of a game as what the player regularly encounters i.e. during a match, while indicating that the game has matches that most likely offer the same content repeatedly. In contrast to that, the cyclic tag provides the user to tag games that encourage the player to repeat the game after a playthrough by providing information or assets that can be migrated to the next playthrough i.e. via new game+ modi. Furthermore we added order to indicate the manner in which the content can be consumed. For the open tag the player must be able to freely choose in which order actions are taken, resulting in missable content or such."
