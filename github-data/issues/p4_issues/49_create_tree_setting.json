This could for example indicate which items or persons can be found in the game, how the environment looks like, or maybe what topics or themes might be present in the game. Unfortunately this will make it difficult to walk the line between not representing all hypothetically possible settings and not choose terms that are too abstract to give an impression of the game. Futhermore the concrete meaning of each category was still illusive even though we used examples to see how they could fit into the categories. Since we were not able to find a clear differentiation between the terms we chose to iterate a list of games and just collect terms that would descibe the game. These terms should than be used to create a mindmap where we can sort them into categories."
