One essential distinction that can be made is whether the communication takes place between multiple players or if NPCs are involved. The later includes the player communicating with an NPC, multiple NPCs communicating with each other, or even the player character communicating with an NPC. When interaction between two players is possible, the game usually provides tools like text chat, voice chat, gestures or preset communication tools like chat wheel, gestures, markers and pings or sounds. Lastly some games limit the range of communication to the proximity of the source."
