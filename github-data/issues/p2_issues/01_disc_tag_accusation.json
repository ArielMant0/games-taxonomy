This is usually the case in detective games, where the player should point out the culprit. The complexety of available accusations might vary across different games, a game might restrict the player to predefined dialog options leading to a guided experience or a game might force the player to choose from an increased realm of possibilities for example when interacting with other players. When providing a vast realm of possibilities the game can but often does not provide additional support to the player how to proceed or successfully accuse a NPC. This requires the player to think outside of the game and understand connections and relations without additionall guidance, potentially completely shifting the process to the players imagination."
