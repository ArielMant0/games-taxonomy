This is supposed to simulate a dialog between player and NPC allowing both parties to show varying reactions to its counterpart. A vital part of this feature is the choice, since this is the interface for the player to influence the game and alter or change the course of the conversation. This is a direct opposite of cutsceenes in which the player can not react to said sings. This led to us differentiating between player to player, player to npc, npc to npc, and finally npc to player character. The last tag entails games in which the player character might do things on its own whichout the players input. (TODO) Some games also provide proximity based dialog, meaning that the player can only hear a conversation if he is in reach i.e. in proximity."
