                        "body": "The _contradiction_ tag should represent a type of problem in which the player needs to find missmatches between game statements of events. Here it is possible either to tag if a game contains contradications or if the player needs to find those. Specifically we talk about _has contradiction_, _find contradiction_, subversion of expectation gamemechanics and storytelling. Further remarkable ideas entail inconsistent game rules/logic. The main question is whether the player can or must find a contradicition. When finding a contradiction the player might be promted to expose a NPC of lying by showing a contradicting statemant. Furthermore some games limit the player by prohibiting contradicting statements [Baba Is You](https://store.steampowered.com/app/736260/Baba_Is_You/). In general we concluded that logic puzzle should not be included as part of contradiction tags, since it is a normal part of puzzleing to find a solution to a riddle for example via trial and error - the contradictions are not setup by the game rather by the players understanding of the problem.

According to @HendrikBrueckler [The Witness](https://store.steampowered.com/app/210970/The_Witness/) would be a perfect fit regarding induction, while @arielmant0 mentiones chants of sennar. Especially the induction tag was a callenge since deduction was found to be a direct consequence of induction. It was therefore difficult to show in which scenario the induction tag would be correct. Baba is you was another example: here you know the rules but you still need to figure out how to correctly apply them."
