                        "body": "Our discussion initially adressed the two main flawors of customization in games: with and without impact on the gameplay. This revealed that customiazation of a game is unrelated to the impact on playing the game - specifically @ArielMant0 mentioned that playing a game is always a individual and therefore custom experience where the player can choose to play and behave in a certain way. Following this it was necessary to discuss different game components such that they could be distinguish and cathegorised. Especially content with high gameplay impact was found to be related to strategy, for example when composing a team or selecting skills these are customizations that usually occure together with strategic planning. In contrast to these are customizations without inherent functionality. Examples are cosmetic items, the possibilty to change the look of a character (charater editor) or renaming/color selection for gameobjects. This can also includes items that are baught seperatly as long as the advantages are based on personal preference. OBACHT: In rare cases cosmetic items can be exploited to gain gameplay advantages - this is not taken into account, since it is not the primary purpose of said item."
