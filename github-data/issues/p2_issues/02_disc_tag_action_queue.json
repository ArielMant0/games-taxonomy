In most instances the player gets the opportunity to queue commands, these can reach from single commands to one or more NPCs to a list of commands to a large number of NPCs. This also leads to varyious ways to interact or plan a queue. A game with a queue of one action might provide a menu in which the game is paused while a indirectly managed workforce might be displayed via a list of actions that are then automatically distributed and executed by the game. In cases where the game automatically distributes tasks to multiple NPCs the execution can be expected to be parrallel, which differs from games with queues for individual NPCs. Additionally different types of queues might require different GUI options for example when removing a task or increasing its priority."

This might be in the form of a stack of cards. Unfortunately we were not able to clearly define how a _game queue_ might look like, since every game provides some kind of queue for example in form of strung together levels that need to be completed or by quests that have prerequirements. While a clear distinction might exist we were not yet able to clearly articulate it. For the moment we decided revisit this issue in the future but also to add the tag such that games that might fit are already marked and can be included in future discussions."
