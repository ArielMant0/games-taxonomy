Furthermore automations might vary in terms of player freedom - some games provide tools that allow fine grained control while others limit the player to a few parameters that can be setup. This influences the depth/mightiness/complexity of the provided tools and in turn also potential problems and their solutions."

                        "body": "We added the tags _basic_ and _advanced_ to differentiate between automations that for example only automate one game element and those that allow the player to automate complex processes. Furthermore we wanted to show the difference of automations which can be customized fully to those that are predefined (_assemble automation_ and _configure automation_). Finally we indicate the relevance to the game by adding the tags _optional_ and _mandatory_, the latter for example including riddle based games that incorporate automations."
