The latter was specifically tailored to games that provide the tools for the player to play strategically without explicitly expecting the player to device a strategy to succeed. These and other tags were combined under the strategy subtree, which got multiple reworks which included a rename to _strategic planning_ and mergings to a _resource management_ subtree."
