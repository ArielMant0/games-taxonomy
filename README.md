## Description
This repository contains the documentation and the results of the games coding project. This is a project in which the collaborators work together to tag and cathegorize a list of games. This is an ongoing iterative process in which a tree of tags is build an coninously expanded to capture the attributes of a game. This taxonomy should allow the user to analyse the game data and for example research common or uncommon game attributes. The documentation is saved in form of github issues as well as a changelog and notes for each occured meeting.
