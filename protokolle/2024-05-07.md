## Topic 1:  How to proceed with the camera perspective tags?

#### Explanation

Currently the camera perspective tags contain a *first person* as well as an *iso perspective* tag. We think that these tags do not describe similar concepts or can not be compared. Therefore a refinement or a rework of these tags is necessary.

#### Proposition 1 (discarded)

* ~~camera degree of freedom~~
  * ~~free detached -> free movement~~
  * ~~character attached (following)~~
  * ~~camera on rails (with rotation)~~
  * ~~camera on rails (without rotation) (cinematic, no control, game control)~~
  * ~~static camera (location attached, scene changes)~~
  * ~~cinematic camera~~
  * ~~fully controlled~~
  * ~~semi controlled~~
  * ~~no control~~

#### Proposition 2

Split camera related information into the following categories:
**camera type, camera movement & rotation, cutscenes**

We used the definition of the USK for [*cutscenes*](https://usk.de/alle-lexikonbegriffe/cutscene/) to separate it from *quicktime events*.

* camera type
  * first person
  * third person
    * over the shoulder
    * top down (Dota)
    * side-on/side-scroller
  * other
    * no actors involved
    * abstract data/UI
    * straight-on/frontal/ui camera ([Hexcells](https://store.steampowered.com/app/265890/Hexcells/)) \[no player character\]
* camera movement/rotation
  * free
  * player character attached
  * finite options
  * scripted (cinematic, rails)
  * fixed/static
* cutscenes/cinematics/(Zwischensequenz)
  * many
  * few
  * ingame
  * pre rendered
  * quicktime events (input prompt)(under noobsi of cutscenes?)

## Topic 2:  Add simulation tag?

#### Explanation

Games in general simulate certain situations, but some games focus more on that than others. Some games use a considerate amount of resources to simulate its content in every detail to get as near as possible to reality. This might be useful to indicate via a tag. Unfortunately it is difficult to define what a simulation is and what not.

## Topic 3: vio: enact vs vio: experience?

#### Explanation

Both tags are differently defined and _vio: enact_ is used a lot. _vio: experience_ maybe is more of a topic tag in regards to its definition.
