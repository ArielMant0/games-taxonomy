## Topic 7: Regarding tag-tree problem types

### Explanation

How should the problem types be used and how are the different tags differentiated? We discussed multiple options that address different subproblems in a multitude of ways.

#### Option 1

It is only allowed to select one problem type from the list, forcing the user to prioritize and select the most fitting one. This in turn would lead to problem solving techniques that might be selected for a game while no appropriate problem type is tagged.

#### Option 2

It is allowed to select an unlimited number of problem types from the list. This would allow for a 1:N relationship between problem types and solving techniques, essentially allowing the user to double check if a problem type has appropriate solving techniques and if each solving technique can be used for a tagged problem type. The problem would be overtagging: Since there are no limiting rules and the definition of the tags is somewhat open the user might assign every or many problem types to one or many games.

#### Option 3

As Option 1, but with additional tagging options for sub-problem types. This would be similar to the minigame tags (mini: logic) which could also be added to the problem types subtree. This would allow the user to mark one main problem type, while not losing further information that might be person specific.

#### Option 4

Remove the problem type altogether. This would solve the definition problem but would also require the problem solving techniques to be renamed, leading to loss of information. Furthermore it is difficult to validate if this is the *right* choice or if the authors just were not able to achieve a coherent tagging system.

### Solution

We choose to use something similar to Option 1\. **For the moment the user is allowed to select up to three problem types from the subtree, focusing on one if possible and including a numbered hierarchy to highlight the priority.** This should provide the user the option to tag multiple problem types while simultaneously providing a ranking which problem types are more important. To test this approach we will assign these tags to a small list of games. This might give us the opportunity to further analyze the problem and work out further adjustments. For example we will be able to identify similarities and might be able to work out if the bias and randomness rendered the tag useless.

**Games that each of us played:**
**Colorcoding:**

- **Green: Mostly identical**
- **Orange: Similar tags but varying order**
- **White: Varying tags**
- **Red: Varying tags and/or TODO tag**

Since it is not possible to define each problem type totally accurately, we choose to base our decision more on **vibe** and **experience** making the selection **subjective**. Each user should choose the tags based on the experience and challenges that the user encountered while playing the game. This allows for different perspectives and multiple valid answers since the experience of playing a game can vary from player to player. Although this introduces bias and uncertainty itself, we still tried to define each problem type as clearly as possible to improve understandability and reduce the danger of wrongly tagged games.

**Definitions:**

**challenge-less**

* rename to *problemtype-todo* or delete in the future? (→ Änderungsbedarfs Tag)
* search examples for this tag

**game of skill or dexterity**

* timed sequence/combination of inputs (that must likely be learned through practice)
* motor skills, hand eye coordination

**labor diligence busywork**

* for limited time continuous task with key components that need to be repeated
* main way to solve involves quantity/repetition of player actions rather than quality of player actions (+outcome of action is repetitive too)

**logic challenges**

* next logical step(s) result from rules and the current state
* limited number of logical steps, non heuristical
* an [argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument) is **valid** [if and only if](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_and_only_if) it takes a form that makes it impossible for the [premises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premise) to be [true](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth) and the conclusion nevertheless to be [false](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_\(logic\))
* Formal logic is interested in deductively [valid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_\(logic\)) arguments, for which the truth of their premises ensures the truth of their conclusion
* inference, deduction
* global rules \+ instances — (logic) → correctly infer gaps in instances

**moral and emotional challenges**

* (endure(experience(explore))) emotional/moral implications of events or your actions or those of NPC

**strategy problem**

* many possible decisions && (uncertainty || heuristic approach || temporal constraint(s) || combinatorial explosion)

**Additional Notes:**

* different types of strategy exist
  * turn based ([Banner Saga](https://store.steampowered.com/app/237990/The_Banner_Saga/))
  * real time ([Starcraft](https://starcraft2.blizzard.com/de-de/))
  * resource based (Anno / Banished)
  * unlimited time planning / logic challenge? ([Adventure Capitalist](https://store.steampowered.com/app/346900/AdVenture_Capitalist/))
  * optimization
* *challenge* is difficult to define
* proving a problem type is valid for a game is difficult
  * extensive description would be required
* Defining the problem type via “the problem that the user is required to solve” would be possible but might be difficult
* A game can be tagged strategic planning without being a strategy problem
  * possible but also unclear (hand wavy), difficult to differentiate
