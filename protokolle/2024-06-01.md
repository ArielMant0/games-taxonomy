## Topic 7: Regarding tag-tree problem types

### Explanation

After reworking the problem types and defining the child tags, we assigned the tags to a subset of games. The results were discussed in this meeting.

### Improvements

The name problem types suggest an unbiased meaning while the tagging is highly personal.

* Rename problem types to personal challenges

Emotional and moral challenges might be but not necessarily connected. A moral challenge for example might be choice (i.e. Minecraft) while an emotional challenge might be connected to a character or his fate. This might even lead to the player not continuing the game but does not require a morally challenging situation. Other games like Frostpunk present a moral challenge while likely not having an emotional impact on the player.

* Split emotional and moral challenges

Since emotional or moral events are not a challenge these will not be part of the personal challenges tree. Instead a new category for emotional events will be created. For an emotional event to be a challenge the event is required to force an input or action from the player (i.e. [BioShock™](https://store.steampowered.com/app/7670/BioShock/), killing little sisters). These tags are for emotional taxing scenes or narratives that can not be controlled. Similarly to the personal challenges these tags are also subjective and may vary across different players.

* emotional events
  * plot twists ([BioShock™](https://store.steampowered.com/app/7670/BioShock/))
  * humoristic events → aufdröseln, da humor auch emotional
  * suspenseful, sims (entspannend)
  * loss, sadness, grief
  * Krieg, death, aging, …

For further clarification we also decided that strategy problem does include:

* resource management
* social deduction

Lastly we added a new personal challenge as a pendant to exploration for games that are challenge less.

* personal challenge: discovery

#### New Questions:

* Revisit and checkup (01.06)
  * Games like [Among Us](https://store.steampowered.com/app/945360/Among_Us/)
  * emotional and moral challenges

#### New Topic: Topic 8: Finish emotional events

#### Resolved Questions:

* ~~Is the problem type useless like this?~~ (22.05) \[01.06\]
* ~~What is its goal in general?~~ (22.05) \[01.06\]
* ~~How should we interpret it?~~ (22.05) \[01.06\]
* ~~Use “time spend” as part of the definition – “The player should use most of the game time doing X”~~ (22.05) \[01.06\]
  * ~~mini, medium and main component (problem type) with mini being minigames~~
  * ~~This might allow to differentiate between games like [Adventure Capitalist](https://store.steampowered.com/app/346900/AdVenture_Capitalist/), [Banner Saga](https://store.steampowered.com/app/237990/The_Banner_Saga/) and [Starcraft](https://starcraft2.blizzard.com/de-de/) → in [Adventure Capitalist](https://store.steampowered.com/app/346900/AdVenture_Capitalist/) you will be waiting most of the time, while in [Starcraft](https://starcraft2.blizzard.com/de-de/) you need to continuously play strategically~~
* ~~Are there *challenge less* games or todo-tags?~~ (22.05) \[01.06\]
* ~~Games that provide an explorative narrative but nothing else.~~ (12.05) \[01.06\]
  * [~~Dear Esther~~](https://store.steampowered.com/app/520720/Dear_Esther_Landmark_Edition/) ~~(Walking Simulator)~~
  * ~~Sol: Discovery~~
* *~~challenge less~~* ~~games? (12.05)~~ \[01.06\]
  * [~~Adventure Capitalist~~](https://store.steampowered.com/app/346900/AdVenture_Capitalist/) ~~(Cooky Clicker)~~

## Topic 5: Should we tag the goal of a game?

### Discussion

Due to the rework of the problem types the need for tagging the goals of a game was already limited from the start of the discussion. Nevertheless we opted to discuss the topic and began by answering a few basic questions. Firstly it was important to define whether the goal of a game might be equal to the ending of a game. This proposition was rejected and the end state was defined as something that is not required to be the narrative ending. Regardless of this distinction we were not able to clearly define the goal of the game and instead discussed why the tag might be needed. The reason being the idea to construct a sentence defining key properties of a game. Since this might focus too much on the story of a game (“The goal of a game is to avenge your parents.”). We instead shifted our focus to the main motivation of a game. Possible motivation might be related to:

* new regions to be explored
* completionist
* competition
* challenges and high skill ceiling (i.e. roguelikes)
  * permanent death, losing stuff when death
  * adaptive difficulty
  * new game+
* multiple storylines

We devised three main categories these motivations can be assigned to:

* **punishments** (negative consequences)
* **incentives**
* **rewards**

Additionally we added a different subtree displaying the structure of a game. This subtree is supposed to show the structured form the game uses to present its content. A key distinction to be made was a game being a match or a game containing matches. Especially for this we added the match based identifier, which allows us to tag the structure of a game as what the player regularly encounters i.e. during a match, while indicating that the game has matches that most likely offer the same content repeatedly. In contrast to that, the cyclic tag provides the user to tag games that encourage the player to repeat the game after a playthrough by providing information or assets that can be migrated to the next playthrough i.e. via new game+ modi. Furthermore we added order to indicate the manner in which the content can be consumed. For the open tag the player must be able to freely choose in which order actions are taken, resulting in missable content or such.

* **order** (one or the other)
  * **linear** ~~narrative~~ (Banner Saga / Starcraft)
  * **branches** / ~~treelike~~
  * **open** ~~world~~ / parallel
* **chunkiness**
  * **paketweise**, stepwise / häppchen / level (isolated)
  * **continuous** (~~nahtlos~~)
* **match based**, instance based (the same but different)
  * basic gameplay that is repeated every time
  * complete content is available
* **Spielerlebnis** (verschiedene Modi, z.B. Mass Effect)
  * **homogen**
  * **heterogen**
* **cyclic**

#### Resolved Questions:

* ~~Is the goal of a game equal to the ending of a game?~~ (12.05) \[01.06\]
