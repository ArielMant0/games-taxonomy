## Results of out last session

To recap the last session we talked about the events and results of the last session. For this we used the summary of the meeting.

## The current state

### Discuss the application

We discussed the current state of the application, meaning the new layout and the new features
surrounding the externalization tree. This included for example adding new games, evidence and externalizations, as well as collapsing subtrees in the transition view.

### Discuss how the new settings tags impact other tags

The results from the last session were a lot of tags that were sorted by category but were not
evaluated in it self. Therefore the question was how we should proceed, which tags should be
included in the tree, which one should not and why.
Furthermore potential duplications should be discussed and removed.

#### Issue #24: Judge tag accusation

As previously discussed this tag might be redundant or to low level to be included.
It was not categorized as a topic or theme and mostly part of detective work.
The other part of accusation would be the mechanical implications like when the game provides mechanics to accuse someone for example in form of dialog options.
This might not be represented in the tree well enough, but for this another term would be required,
since even though the accusation tag implies a mechanical feature it does not describe it.
Especially the difference to usual dialog options is unclear and heavily dependent on the context.
This makes it difficult, since it might be useful to differentiate between detective games,
that provide these mechanics and those which do not, but concurrently this would specializes the tree for those games.

When comparing normal dialog options to an accusation, it can be observed that an accusation is likely to have **consequences** in the game.
Unfortunately not every dialog option with a consequence is an accusation, making differentiation difficult again. Furthermore accessing the relevance of a consequence or the impact of an accusation is also difficult,
for example a game showing accusations without the input of the player via cutscenes could be difficult to judge depending on the context or when choosing one out of N options, does the number of possibilities impact the tag?

We concluded that accusation might not even include a signature mechanic but rather is impacted by the semantic. Here we differentiate games that give the player a list of tasks to do followed by an accusation and
games that give more freedom resulting in the player being required to make a decision under uncertainty.
In both cases this might be part of narrative choices and branches since both cases do not result in the player replaying the section, but instead the game continuing with the made choice.

game | tag | mechanic
---|---|---
[Among Us](https://store.steampowered.com/app/945360/Among_Us/) | _social deduction_ | voting
[Life is Strange](https://store.steampowered.com/app/319630/Life_is_Strange__Episode_1/) | _choose dialog option_ | accuse person of something
[Paradise Killer](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1160220/Paradise_Killer/) | _choose dialog option_ | accuse person of something
[Her Story](https://store.steampowered.com/app/368370/Her_Story/) | ? | intern not in the game
[Heavy Rain](https://store.steampowered.com/app/960910/Heavy_Rain/) | ? | ?
[Papers Please](https://store.steampowered.com/app/239030/Papers_Please/) | overfitting? | just decide whether to accuse or not

Finally we decided to delete _accusation_ until further notice and revisit this in further iterations.
Up until then _accusation_ is supposed to be part of:

- _detective work_ (topic)
- _narrative branches_ (semantic)
- _choose dialog options_ (mechanic)
- _gather information_ (problem solving)

#### Issue #33: Judge tag contradiction

Similarly to _accusation_ _contradiction_ is a tag that depicts a concrete game feature or a
part of a game, that allows or expects the player to experience content in a certain way.

To start of it is important to note, that _contradiction_ is not equal to exclusion principle (Ausschlussprinzip).
This is expected to be part of _logic puzzles_ and _apply rules_ or similar tags,
therefore excluding games like [Return of the Obra Dinn](https://store.steampowered.com/app/653530/Return_of_the_Obra_Dinn/) or [Hexcells](https://store.steampowered.com/app/265890/Hexcells/), since the data the game provides does not in itself contradict itself.
These games provide logic puzzles or riddles that can be solved by applying certain techniques,
but are not tailored around contradiction.
Consequently such games do not provide a specific mechanic to e.g. mark contradictions, which also applies to [Among Us](https://store.steampowered.com/app/945360/Among_Us/) where only the statements of players can contradict and even in these cases there is no specific game mechanic for it.

Games that are more critical are for example [The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1158850/The_Great_Ace_Attorney_Chronicles/) where the some kind of lie detection or fact checking takes place.
This can also influence the mechanics the game provides, but is also dependent on the semantic.
Especially based on [Her Story](https://store.steampowered.com/app/368370/Her_Story/) we found,
that the player also brings a certain mindset to the game - in this case the goal to find inconsistencies.
Which might be sufficiently be portrayed by _detective work_, _social deduction_ or _gather information_.

game | terms | description
---|---|---
[The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1158850/The_Great_Ace_Attorney_Chronicles/) | detect lies | mechanic, logic components
[Her Story](https://store.steampowered.com/app/368370/Her_Story/) | social deduction | find inconsistencies
[Papers Please](https://store.steampowered.com/app/239030/Papers_Please/) | fact checking / spot the difference | investigation
[Antichamber](https://store.steampowered.com/app/219890/Antichamber/) | subversion | riddles
[Primordia](https://store.steampowered.com/app/227000/Primordia/) | imperfect information | narrative world building

Finally we decided to delete all _contradiction_ tags until further notice and revisit this in further iterations.
The key results of our discussion were:

- the exclusion principle is part of _logic puzzles_
- _contradiction_ is related to _deduction_ or logical deduction
- finding inconsistencies might need to be added, but could be part of _gather information_
- detect lies might be a mechanic that needs to be added - detective work is underrepresented in  mechanics tree
- also depends on the definition of _apply rules_ → rework
- manual type of data analysis
- _contradiction_ can be part of _narrative branches_, when NPCs lie (semantic)

#### Issue #46: Discuss subtree violence

The proposal for this tag was also to delete it, especially since the topics already contain multiple instances of violence. What would get lost in the process would be the information in
which games the player explicitly enacts violence or in which the player does not.
As a result we found, that _vio: enact_ might fit into the _problem solving techniques_ tree,
since it is a valid strategy and directly opposes reasoning.
In this case it might even be useful to further divide this category into violence against other
lifeforms, objects (destruction) or emotional violence, but this was postponed to later discussions.

The key results of our discussion were:

- _vio: enact_ as a _problem solving techniques_
- _vio: experience_ is part of _topics_ and _emotional challenges_

#### Discuss new topics tags

Since we discussed the violence tags shortly before we opted to discuss the categories of the
new found topics/themes tags. Here multiple terms are very similar in terms of content, consequently requiring abstractions.

In the following section proposals for each tag can be found how to proceed with them.

Deciding which tags are important was especially difficult for the tags related to non human lifeform i.e. _monsters_, _creatures_, _aliens_.
Here the differentiation between _monsters_ and _creatures_ was difficult. One initial idea was to use sentience and consciousness for identification, since aliens might fly with a spaceship, while creatures like animals might not.
Unfortunately this does not hold up against fantasy creatures that might have build a civilization or can talk - for example a dragon could be a simple creature, but could also be a creature with a history or similar ([TES V: Skyrim](https://store.steampowered.com/app/489830/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim_Special_Edition/)).
Additionally we found, that the original idea is to indicate whether a game has dragons or not rather than showing how advanced they are.
On the other hand it is difficult to identify games that have _creatures_ or similar as tag anyway - even though [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us) has _monsters_ and _creatures_ (animals) neither should be a topic of this game.
Finally we wondered whether it might be important to add animals as a tag for example for games like [Pferd & Pony: Mein Pferdehof](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limbic_Entertainment) where the horse would be an essential part of the game and _creatures_ might not sufficiently represent that.

Until further discussion we decided to keep _creatures_ and _monsters_, but this should be something to revisit in the future.

##### Future Questions

How significant must a setting or topic be, to get tagged?

Should it be possible to generally prove a topic by providing evidence?

#### Issue #43: Rework subtree topics & Issue #49: Create subtree setting

Both issues are highly related to each other and we concluded to merge them.

#### Issue #52: Discuss tag emotional events

This tag is also related to topics and multiple of the terms mentioned in the issue are also present in the mindmap we created.
Here we found that games can either address emotions as a topic, talking about sadness, helplessness or loss while a game might also evoke emotions by the player.
These are difficult to separate since they most likely both mean that the player experiences emotional events.

In general it would be possible to tag the emotions the player feels when playing the game, similar to _personal challenges_.
One problem with this would be the disconnect between what happens in the game and what the player feels - even though a game might be about grief the player might still feel happiness ([Gris](https://store.steampowered.com/app/683320/GRIS/)).
This might or might not be worth tagging anyway, since it might also be interesting and remarkable when such games would be tagged with positive emotions.

Finally both the tagging of emotions as topics and the felt emotions were moved to a new issue and the discussion was postponed until the next phase.

### Issue #26: Rework subtree automation

The problem with the automation subtree are mostly the _basic_ and _advanced_ tag, since they are difficult to differentiate. Additionally _assemble_ and _configure_ were not used consistently most likely due to a vage definition.
The idea was to show the conceptual difference between choosing values for automation or combining parts to create an automation.

 tag        | definition
------------|--------
_assemble_  | build a automata e.g. building blocks
_configure_ | chose settings for automata

Since the goal was mainly to clean up this subtree, we agreed to keep these tags and remove the tags indicating the complexity - possibly adding _assemble_ to the _building & crafting_ subtree.

Nevertheless we discussed some special cases based on the games that were assigned these tags.

game   | tag                   | notes
-------|-----------------------|--------
[Plants vs. Zombies GOTY Edition](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3590/Plants_vs_Zombies_GOTY_Edition/) | ? | unit attack on their own
[Baba Is You](https://store.steampowered.com/app/736260/Baba_Is_You/) | configure |
[Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us) | assemble, configure | configure after building, externalization blueprint via mods
[Anno 1800](https://store.steampowered.com/app/916440/Anno_1800/) | (assemble?), configure | configure after creation
[Don't Starve Together](https://store.steampowered.com/app/322330/Dont_Starve_Together/) | (configure?) | craft menu, different complexity

In general we found that _auto: basic_ could be misunderstood in cases where the game itself add basic automations like units that attack on their own. Generally it can be said, that
"Everything that is not done manually happens automatically." ([@HendrikBrueckler](https://github.com/HendrikBrueckler)).

Furthermore we saw that there might also be a special case when building a automata (_build_) using a recipe or blueprint instead of assembling it freely.
This is similar to depicting the complexity of an automation, for which an alternative representation using _high level_ and _low level_ was proposed.
This differentiation might especially be important for externalization features, since it could be more likely that a game with complex automations provides some tool for that.
In contrast to that a _configure_ automation might be likely to be shown via an interface allowing only to select components or values.

Especially due to the externalization component it might be important to revisit this discussion in the future, such that more features can be portrayed.
