## Issue #55: Create subtree replayability and cyclic structure

### Discussion

We discussed the structure tags that each of us gave the games of the list. This led to a heterogeneous distribution of tags across the three participants. Due to time constraints we choose to only talk about the cyclic tag.
We found that it is difficult to pinpoint which games should be tagged as such. In general we discussed a lot of games that have similar components or features that could be classified as cyclic but vary largely.
Games that were part of the discussion were:

- [Tetris® Effect](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1003590/Tetris_Effect_Connected/)
- [Dota 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/570/Dota_2/)
- [Diablo® IV](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2344520/Diablo_IV/)
- [Hades](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145360/Hades/)
- [World of Warcraft](https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/de-de/)
- [Borderlands 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/49520/Borderlands_2/)
- [The Stanley Parable](https://store.steampowered.com/app/221910/The_Stanley_Parable/)
- [FTL: Faster Than Light](https://store.steampowered.com/app/212680/FTL_Faster_Than_Light/) (Rogue Likes)
- [Banished](https://store.steampowered.com/app/242920/Banished/),
- [Anno 1800](https://store.steampowered.com/app/916440/Anno_1800/),
- [Batman: Arkham City](https://store.steampowered.com/app/200260/Batman_Arkham_City__Game_of_the_Year_Edition/),
- [Antichamber](https://store.steampowered.com/app/219890/Antichamber/),
- [SUPERHOT](https://store.steampowered.com/app/322500/SUPERHOT/),
- [Super Meat Boy](https://store.steampowered.com/app/40800/Super_Meat_Boy/),
- [Portal](https://store.steampowered.com/app/400/Portal/)

Each of these games has gameplay features that can be classified as cyclic but each of them has a highly varying impact on the gameplay. The main focus of this tag were games like FTL, that give the player an incentive to play the game again and again after a finished round. Finishing a round unlocks game elements that impact future runs.
**This content provides new challenges for the player for example in terms of difficulty. Generally similarities to new game+ modi can be found, but even if a second run allows to solve previously unsolvable puzzles the difficulty stays the same and the player is not forced to adjust his strategy.**
Similarly games like The Stanley Parable allow the player to adjust his playstyle based on information collected in previous runs or require the player to repeatedly play the story to gain access to the complete narrative.
Finally it must be mentioned that curiosity is not sufficient to call a game cyclic since this is an internal player motivation. Furthermore games like Banished and Anno provide an opposite gameplay loop because these games are open ended.

### Results

We propose a subtree that classifies the replayability of a game. Using a combination of different tags the user can express the replayability of a game and which feature the game provides to increase the replayability.
