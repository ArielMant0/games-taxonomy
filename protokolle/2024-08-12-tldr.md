# 12.08.2024 (Mo) tl;dr

We talked about...

- the general Timetable
- that the USK 18 is to be removed
- settings, themes, topics, motives
  - general understanding
  - different games and what they contain
- hide: self
  - We will add stealth mechanics.
  - If there are similar tags needed we will find out in the next tagging phase.
- subtree queue
  - REMOVE: queue game
  - ADD Tag: turn based
  - ADD Topic: card game / board game
  - REMOVE: direct
  - REMOVE: indirect
  - REMOVE: input buffer
  - REMOVE: sequential
  - REMOVE: parallel
  - We will check if there are any major uses of the to be removed tags and if we find nothing, we will just use command or action queue for all queues that are visually represented in the game.
  - indirect, parallel: Games were you can assign a group of units a task (like resource harvesting in warcraft) (invisible queue)
  - indirect, parallel: Project Highrise
