## Issue #50: Discuss tagging goal of a game

### Discussion

We discussed the need for tagging the goal of a game again and came to the conclusion that is not needed. The main purpose of this tag was to indicate why a player plays a game but since this is part of the motivations subtree (#53) now this tag is not needed.
However our discussion revealed the possibility to tag the game over condition of a game. This resulted in a new issue.

## Issue #56: Create subtree game over condition

### Discussion

Since it was difficult for us to define the goal of a game and we already included tags for motivations it was proposed to add tags for the game over condition. This would yield a very similar result but might be more clearly definable.

A game over condition is generally independent of the goal or the end of a game, since the game
can also be over when the player dies. Therefore the game over condition is directly related to
conditions that let the player win or lose. Hence every end state that is available was reached
by triggering a game over condition. This in turn means, that a game that does not have an end state would also not have a game over condition. Basically this tag identifies situations in which the game itself stops the player from continuing to play - this does also include situations in which the player would resolve the issue by reloading.

Especially noteworthy here are games, that integrate the player death into the game ([DARK SOULS™: REMASTERED](https://store.steampowered.com/app/570940/DARK_SOULS_REMASTERED/)), creating a different approach to process a potential game over.
The difference between those games and others would be visible via these tags, allowing the analyst to obtain information about the structure of the game.

While it is important to differentiate the game over condition from the goal of a game,
since both can differ a lot, we choose to not differentiate between a good and bad game overs like death or finishing the game. Furthermore we decided for now to not include a special tag for loading a savegame since it is a very mechanical feature and usual for many games.

In general a lot of potential game over conditions would be of technical nature:

- finish last quest of the game
- reach final location
- kill final boss
- endure challenge

Basically this tag should also give a hint as to what the challenge of the game is, on a more technical level than the _problem types_ subtree.

For the moment we reused information from issue #50 and decided on the following tags to choose from:

- win match
- beat final level
- kill endboss
- get high score
- survive as long as possible
- solve big level/puzzle/riddle
- reach end of storyline
- bring story to end
- follow storyline
- complete main quest line
- complete game
- no explicit goal
- death

These tag might be detailed enough while still given some abstraction level. To select the correct tag we agreed to prioritize quests and questlines over location based tags. Ongoing problems that already were found are:

- Does the game end because the story is finished, or is the story finished because the game has ended?
- What about story that are not bound to quests?
- Games might not tell the player that there is a questline and not just one quest.

Nevertheless to validate our list we will iterate a list of games and assign those potential tags.

## Issue #51: Discuss tagging USK

### Discussion

Related tags would have the purpose to indicate who is playing the game. This might be cultural interesting but also would give a brought overview about the content of the game: Does the game contain violent visuals?
Or does it contain drug use or heavy language?
Is it viable for kids to play it? and so on.

When discussing this topic we found multiple problems regarding ratings. Firstly it is difficult to access this as an uninformed person that does not do this professionally since it might require in depth game knowledge and generally a system to compare games to each other.
Such a tag would simple be more difficult to tag than for example tags related to minigames or visual features.
Secondly it is not guaranteed that a user would rate a game consistently at different time points, meaning the values would be subject to change,
which in turn would require the user to regularly update corelated tags.

We finally concluded that it would be unreasonable to add such a tag by ourselves,
simply because we would probably rebuild rating systems that already exist from big organizations like the [USK](https://usk.de/en/) or [PEGI](https://pegi.info).
We therefore shifted the focus to a technical solution: Instead of using tags we aim to add a feature to the [collacode](https://github.com/ArielMant0/collacode) application allowing it to crawl various information about the games from said rating organizations.
This would allow for updates when ratings change and would also shift the responsibility for correct data to the organizations.

Despite this we discussed whether there might be features that can and should be tagged anyway. The proposition was to re-orientate the focus to gameplay relevant elements.
Like this simple occurrences of nudity or violence would not automatically require the related tag.

**Which content exists in the game and how is it contained in the gameplay. There are various areas that can influence this topic, like optics (real vs comic) or the seriousness of the game (slapstick).**

**Since we also found relations to subtrees like #43 or #46 we opted to discuss these trees first before adding a potential new subtree. Consequently we closed this issue and created a new issue for the next milestone.**

Nevertheless we shortly iterated over the categories that are usually used by USK and PEGI for their ratings.
